I never knew winter could be so beautiful.
YEAH...
It really is beautiful, isn't it?
But it's so white.
You know, how about a little color?
Must we bleach the joy out of it all?
I'm thinking like maybe some crimson, chartreuse...
How `bout yellow--no, not yellow.
Yellow and snow?
Brrrr...no go.
Am I right?
Hi!
You're creepy.
I don't want it!
Backatchya!
Please don't drop me.
Don't!
Come on, it's just a head.
No!
All right, we got off to a bad start.
Ew, ew, the body!
Wait, what am I looking at right now?
Why are you hanging off the earth like a bat?
...Okay.
Wait one second.
Oooh!
Thank you!
You're welcome.
Now I'm perfect.
Well, almost.
Woo!
Head rush!
Oh!
Too hard.
I'm sorry! 
I-I, I was just.... Are you okay?
Are you kidding me?
I am wonderful!
I've always wanted a nose.
So cute.
It's like a little baby unicorn.
What?
Hey!
Whoa.
Oh, I love it even more!
Hah....
All right, let's start this thing over. 
Hi everyone.
I'm [PERSON] . 
And I like warm hugs.
Olaf?...That's right, [PERSON] .
...And you are?
Oh, um...I'm [PERSON] .
And who's the funky-looking donkey over there?
That's [PERSON] .
Uh-huh.
And who's the reindeer?
...[PERSON] .
Oh.
They're--oh, okay....
Makes things easier for me.
Ha. Aw, look at him tryin' to kiss my nose.
I like you, too!
[PERSON] , did [PERSON] build you?
Yeah. Why?
Do you know where she is?
Fascinating...
Yeah. Why?
Do you think you could show us the way?
Yeah. Why?
How does this work?
Stop it, [PERSON] .
Trying to focus here.
Yeah, why?
I'll tell you why.
We need Elsa to bring back summer.
Summer?
Oh, I don't know why but I've always loved the idea of summer, and sun, and all things hot.
Really?
I'm guessing you don't have much experience with heat.
Nope.
But sometimes I like to close my eyes and imagine what it'd be like when summer does come.
