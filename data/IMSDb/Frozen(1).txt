Yeah, the whole thing!
You got it.
They laugh as the krumkake crumbles in his face.
Okay wait, wait.
So you have how many brothers?
Twelve older brothers.
Three of them pretended I was invisible... literally...for two years.
That's horrible.
It's what brothers do.
...And sisters.
[PERSON] and I were really close when we were little.
But then, one day she just shut me out, and I never knew why.
I would never shut you out.
Okay, can I just say something crazy?
I love crazy.
ALL MY LIFE HAS BEEN A SERIES OF DOORS IN MY FACE.
AND THEN SUDDENLY I BUMP INTO YOU.
I was thinking the same thing, because like. . .
I'VE BEEN SEARCHING MY WHOLE LIFE TO FIND MY OWN PLACE.
AND MAYBE IT'S THE PARTY TALKING, OR THE CHOCOLATE FONDUE.
BUT WITH YOU-
BUT WITH YOU,
I FOUND MY PLACE.
I SEE YOUR FACE.
AND IT'S NOTHING LIKE I'VE EVER KNOWN BEFORE.
LOVE IS AN OPEN DOOR!
LOVE IS AN OPEN DOOR!
LOVE IS AN OPEN DOOR
WITH YOU!
WITH YOU!
WITH YOU!
WITH YOU!
LOVE IS AN OPEN DOOR.
I MEAN IT'S CRAZY.
What?
WE FINISH EACH OTHER'S-
SANDWICHES!
That's what I was gonna say!

I'VE NEVER MET SOMEONE- WHO THINKS SO MUCH LIKE ME.
OUR MENTAL SYNCHRONIZATION CAN HAVE BUT ONE EXPLANATION,
YOU- AND I- WERE- JUST- MEANT TO BE.
SAY GOODBYE- SAY GOODBYE-
TO THE PAIN OF THE PAST.
WE DON'T HAVE TO FEEL IT ANYMORE!
LOVE IS AN OPEN- DOOR! 
LOVE IS AN OPEN DOOR!
LIFE CAN BE SO MUCH MORE-
WITH YOU!
WITH YOU!
WITH YOU!
WITH YOU!
LOVE IS AN OPEN DOOR.
Can I say something crazy...? 
Will you marry me?
Can I just say something even crazier? 
Yes.
