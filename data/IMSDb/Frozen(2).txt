Your Majesty, if I may ease your--
No, you may not.
And I think you should go.
The party is over.
Close the gates.
What?
[PERSON] , no. No, wait!
Give me my glove!
Elsa, please.
Please.
I can't live like this anymore.
...Then leave.
...What did I ever do to you?!
Enough, [PERSON] .
No. Why?
Why do you shut me out?!
Why do you shut the world out?!
What are you so afraid of?!
I said, enough!
...Sorcery. I knew there was something dubious going on here.
There she is. 
Your Majesty! 
Long live the Queen! 
Queen [PERSON] .... 
Come drink with us.
Queen [PERSON] .
Your Majesty?
Are you all right?
There she is!
Stop her!
Please, just stay away from me.
Stay away!
Monster....
Monster!
[PERSON] !
[PERSON] !
Wait, please!
[PERSON] , stop!
[PERSON] !
No.
Look.... The fjord.
Snow? 
It's...snow...in July.
...Are you all right?
No.
Did you know?
No.
Look! 
It's snowing! 
It's snowing!
The Queen has cursed this land! 
She must be stopped!
You have to go after her.
Wait, no!
You!
Is there sorcery in you, too?
Are you a monster, too?
No. No. I'm completely ordinary.
That's right she is...
...in the best way.
...And my sister's not a monster.
She nearly killed me.
You slipped on ice.
Her ice!
It was an accident. 
She was scared. 
She didn't mean it.
She didn't mean any of this....
Tonight was my fault.
I pushed her.
So I'm the one that needs to go after her.
Yes. Fine. Do.
What?
Bring me my horse, please.
[PERSON] , no.
It's too dangerous.
[PERSON] 's not dangerous. 
I'll bring her back, and I'll make this right.
I'm coming with you.
No, I need you here to take care of [LOCATION] .
...On my honor.
I leave Prince [PERSON] in charge!
Are you sure you can trust her?
I don't want you getting hurt.
She's my sister; she would never hurt me.
